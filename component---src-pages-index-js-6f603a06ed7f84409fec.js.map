This site is a one stop location to learn everything there is about me, Jasmeet Oberai.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n              \tI am a Software Engineer graduated from the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about creating. Whether it be through software, or music, or even any other art, I try to push my thoughts and creativity as far they can go.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I'm a huge advocate of agile development. Whether it be test driven development (TDD) or code review, I like finding the bugs just as much as I like squashing them. I also have a great fascination with puzzles and problem-solving. Finding the solution to a complex software problem, to me, is like intense detective work. I find much enjoyment in the piecing together the clues to get to a final outcome.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                That being said, I'm not a total bore that just codes all day. Music is one of my other big passions. I enjoy music in any shape or form whether it be rap, rock, or country. But most of all, I enjoy Indian classical music. I play the instrument known as a Tabla which is an Indian drum that is played with the hands. I am also an avid student of classical Indian vocals.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When I'm not found coding or playing tabla, I can be found playing basketball, soccer and even cricket on the odd occasion.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <h2 class=\"sub-heading\">Archive</h2>\n            <ul class=\"posts\">\n              {posts\n                // .filter(({ node }) => node.frontmatter.layout === 'post')\n                .map(({ node }) => (\n                  <li key={node.id}>\n                    <span class=\"meta\">{node.frontmatter.date }</span>\n                    <span> &raquo; </span>\n                     <Link\n                      to={node.fields.slug}>\n                        {node.frontmatter.title}\n                      </Link>\n                  </li>\n                ))}\n            </ul>\n        </section>\n      </article>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n  )\n}\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
