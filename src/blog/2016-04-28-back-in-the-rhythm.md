Finally ... a post.

Today let's discuss one of my passions ... **Tabla**.

Tabla is a North Indian percussive instrument that is many centuries old. I've been learning tabla, on and off for about 7 years and it has slowly developed from a hobby to a passion over that course of time. The subtlety and tone of the tabla as an instrument is remarkable.

It's a percussive instrument like no other, with a uniquely identifying feature being that it has it's own language. Rarely do percussive instruments have a language let alone one as complex and structured as that of the tabla. It has it's own alphabet and grammar with a great many phrases and compositions that have developed over time.

*Here's a sample, played by a famous tabla maestro known as Ustad Zakir Hussain*

I will talk more about the tabla in later posts. This post was just to get an introduction to the instrument and what it's about.

**P.S.**: I know that I've been delayed in my posts, however, I'm going to venture to post something once every week. Whether it is thoughts, opinions or cool things I've seen.
